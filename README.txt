~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TREEEDITOR ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THIS PYTHON SCRIPT NAMED treeEDITOR TAKES THE DIRECTORY WITHIN

WHICH IT'S BEEN CALLED AS ROOT DIRECTORY, AND FROM THERE,

PERFORMS A DOWNWARD RENAMING (ROOT INCLUDED) -- IF NEEDED -- 

OF SUBDIRECTORIES AND FILES.

IT PURPOSE IS TO TRIM ANNOYING FILENAMES LIKE 

`[ some_reference ]actual_filename.extension` SO THAT IT WILL

REMAIN JUST THE `actual_filename.extention` PART.


NO THIRD-PARTY MODULE NEEDED!


~~ USAGE EXAMPLE ~~

LET'S SUPPOSE YOU COPY THE SCRIPT IN `/home/your_name/github/`,
AND THE TARGET FOLDER TO RUN THE SCRIPT AGAINST IS `dummy_dir`.

$ cd dummy_dir
$ python ~/github/treeEditor.py

..AND TADAM!! NOTHING MORE!! THE MAGIC HAS BEEN DONE.
NO MORE ANNOYING FILENAME IN dummy_dir.


HOPE THIS WILL BE USEFUL TO SOMEONE ...
